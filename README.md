# What is this? 😎

This is the second version of my personal website, **a showcase of my projects and my art**. There's lots of little things that you can interact with, so please give it a try [here](johnzhou.dev). 

> Explore my previous website [here](https://jaayzee.github.io/).

---

# How was this built? 🛠️

This website was designed with heavy influence from the idea of **modern smooth and sleek**:

- **Next.js**: For optimized server-side rendering and seamless routing.
- **React.js**: To build dynamic and reusable UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and efficient styling.
- **TypeScript**: Adding type safety and maintainability.
- **Three.js**: To create personalized 3D visuals and animations.

> **And deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com)!** 🚀

---

# Key Features 🌟

- **Interactive Design**: I wanted much of my website to be played with, and I hope it translates through design.
- **3D Animations**: Built with Three.js, I wanted something sleek and smooth.
- **Optimized Performance**: Utilizing Next.js and Tailwind to ensure fast loading and beautiful layouts, though I'm sure I missed optimizations somewhere.
- **Showcase of Work**: A curated portfolio of my favorite projects and art pieces.

---

# Roadmap 🗺️

### Planned Enhancements:
- **Additional Animations**: I want to transition my dark and light mode smoothly.
- **Loading Screen**: Right now the 3D scenes are slower to load than the rest of the website, I'd like to change that.
- **Optimizations**: The iframe I use to load my resume reloads often, and should be fixed.
